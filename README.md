## Lessons Learned
- I learned how to use React TypeScript better especially when introducing the use of Context API.
- I have also learned the basics of creating responsive grid layouts
- Solidifed knowledge of important JS methods such as .map and .filter 

## Future optimizations
- I will look into redoing the entire UI as it does not look visually appealing. 
- Fix a layout change issue caused on initial load of the page. This is something to do with AnimatePresence initial={false} not working for the correct component so I will need to debug this. 
- localStorage is not working in development mode. The temporary solution is removing StrictMode in the index.tsx but I think either the logic for checking if exisiting notes exist inside a useEffect is not working correctly.
